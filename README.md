								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>IT has become a very wide topic as technology is advancing rapidly. Although all IT topics are interesting, I will only mention two as they are my favorites. The first one is cloud computing because it allows us to store and access data in a virtual one instead of a physical object. The second one is robotics. Robotics has changed our lifestyles drastically by decreasing the workload of humans. Both Cloud computing and robotic has made our daily lives easier.</p>
								<p>My interest in IT started to develop when I got my first ever smartphone, it was also the time where I became much more aware of IT. Another reason that I became interested was because of my father. He would play tinker with the computer and his phone when I was younger and that made me interested in IT.</p>
								<p>I chose to study in RMIT because it is one of the leading universities in Melbourne and ranked among the best universities for technology. It is also because RMIT provides a variety of amazing facilities which created the perfect optimal studying environment for a student.</p>
								<p>During my studies, I hope that I will be able to learn and develop skills which will be able to aid me in the future. For example: social skills, teamwork skills, team leading skills, programming, cloud computing, etc.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/36724644?type=standard</p>
								<p>I chose this job application because it has a few benefits which caught my eye and is the one closest to my ideal job compared to the rest. This job will allow me to have a flexible working hour with an average amount of pay. In the job specification, it stated that I will be working in a team. This is a really interesting point as the workload can be shared amongst the group and also increases the efficiency of everyone. Furthermore, training from professionals will be provided the company. This will allow me to further polish my skills. </p>
								<p>As a web designer, one must have a specific set of skills and a huge space for creativity. I must have the knowledge on how to use coding software such as HTML because it will be used to create the “body” of the website. I will also need to know UX/UI to make the website user friendly. Last but not least, knowledge on Photoshop is also needed as it will make the website pleasing and astatic. As for experience, I personally think that any amount of experience is fine as long as I am able to produce good websites.</p>
								<p>I’m a student studying Bachelor of technology in RMIT and I took the course introduction to information technology, introduction to programming, user centered design and play society. Because of these courses, I already have the basics in programming, UX/UI and knowledge in HTML software. However, I have no experience in web designing and the skills that I currently have will not be sufficient to meet the requirements.</p>
								<p>In order to further develop my current skills, I will have to take online courses and also spend extra hours outside of universities reading books relevant to it. I will have to do more activities that can help me increase my creativity. Other than that I will have to learn more skills such as Photoshop, coding using other software, etc. to meet the requirements.</p>
